\section{Discrete and Continuous Distributions}

\subsection{Motivation}
We will begin by studying distribution functions widely used for quantitative modeling. Having a intuitive understanding of these functions and being able to discern the unique characteristics of a distribution is a valuable skill. 

\subsection{Definitions}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Random Variable: can be discrete or continuous
    \item Cumulative distribution function: \(F(a) = P\{X \leq a\}\), \(\int_{-\infty}^{a} f(x) \,dx\)
    \item Probability mass function: \(p(x) = P\{X=x\}\) 
    \item Probability distribution function: \(f(x) = \frac{d}{dx}F(x)\)
    \item Expected value: \(E[X] = \sum_{x:p(x)>0} xp(x)\), \(\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} xf(x) \,dx\)
    \item Variance: \(var(X) = E[(X-E[X])^2] = E[X^2] - (E[X])^2\)
    \item Bernoulli trial: random experiment with two possible outcomes (success/failure) of consistent probability
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Discrete / Continuous Random Variable Distributions}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Uniform: probability distributions with equally likely outcomes
    \item Binomial (Discrete): probability distributions arising from several Bernoulli trials
    \item Normal (Gaussian): continuous probability distribution associated with the Central Limit Theorem (often used for natural and social sciences)
    \item Poisson (discrete): probability distribution expressing the probability of a given number of events occurring in a fixed interval of time given a known constant mean rate and independence
    \item Gamma: a family of distributions related to the beta, exponential, and chi-squared distributions
    \item Geometric (discrete): probability distribution of the number of Bernoulli trials to get one success  
    \item Exponential: probability distribution of the time between events in a Poisson point process
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Continuous Random Variables}
